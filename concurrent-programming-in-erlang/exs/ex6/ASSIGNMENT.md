### Exercise: Exceptions in the frequency server

**We’ve seen the frequency server and studied how it and its clients can be modified to handle exit signals and termination in general. In this exercise we’ll look at how to use exceptions to deal with unexpected cases in the server.**

There is a supporting file, exceptions.erl, available (as a zip file) under ‘Downloads’ below.

#### Adding exceptions

Add exceptions – and exception handling – to deal with

+ the case where an unallocated frequency is the subject of a deallocation request,
+ the receipt of an unknown message type.

#### Exceptions or not?

Reflect on the solutions that you have built using exceptions. What other approaches could you have used? Do you think that this is the best way of solving the problem. If so, why; if not, what alternative approach would you use, and why? You are invited to discuss this with other course participants in the next step.
