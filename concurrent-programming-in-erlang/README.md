# Concurrent Programming using Erlang

## Introduction

This repository contains a collection of exercises using the Erlang programming language, particularly solved using concurrent oriented strategies.

All this work was done during the *Concurrent programming using Erlang* [course](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/concurrent-programming-erlang/) hosted by Simon Thompson, in the [Futurelearn](https://www.futurelearn.com/) website. It's a 4 weeks course where videos are presented along with exercises and assignments. Students would share their exercises and even reflect on other student's execises as part of the couse steps.

## Exercises

1. [Palindrome checker process](exs/ex1/README.md)
2. [Mailboxes: handling messages order](exs/ex2/README.md)
