### The 'nub' function

Here’s another example - the nub function. This returns the list with all repetitions of elements removed.

After watching this video, have a go at defining nub. Share your approach to this problem, and discuss with others, in the comments for this step.

Define a function nub to remove all the duplicate elements from a list. This could remove all repeated elements except the first instance, or all repeated elements except the final instance.

```erlang
nub([2,4,1,3,3,1]) = [2,4,1,3]

nub([2,4,1,3,3,1]) = [2,4,3,1]
```
