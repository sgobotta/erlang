### Towards patterns for defining functions

In this video we continue to explore ways of defining functions over lists in Erlang.

We’ll continue to look at our example involving geometric shapes. In this particular example, we’ll be extracting elements from a list. This will lead us into considering general patterns – combining, transforming and filtering – for functions over lists.

Finally, we’ll return to the question of how lists and tuples are different, and also introduce some further examples for you to think about. You might like to discuss these examples using the comments on this step.

Note that there is a supporting file shapes.erl available under ‘Downloads’ below.
