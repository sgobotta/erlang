### The basics of Erlang programming

In this step we’ll begin to go through the basics of writing a Erlang program.

We’ll use an Erlang shell and a text editor to consider the “edit-save-compile” workflow - first editing simple functions in the text editor, saving these, and then compiling in the shell.

We’ll also see Simon make a couple of errors in this process, highlighting important issues to remember when programming.

The example module used in the video - first.erl - is available under ‘Downloads’ below.
