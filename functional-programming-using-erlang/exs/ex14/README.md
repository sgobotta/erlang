### Recap: Week 2 so far

Before we go on to look at some further examples, here’s a brief video summary of what we’ve learned so far this week.

In this video, Simon also introduces some examples that we’ll be looking at in the next activity. We’ll be thinking about where to begin when presented with a problem to solve - so, before we look at the details in the next section, it would be a good idea to first think about how you might go about tackling these examples.
